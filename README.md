  The purpose of this project was to create a system that is able to define the authorship of the given text. This task can be reffered to as a multi class classification problem, where known writers/authors are classes and texts are elements that need to be classified. In this project I decided to use Support Vector Machine as a binary classifier combined with Error-Correcting Output Coding method to achieve higher precision.
  In our particular situation we limited the number of classes to 10 what means that only texts that were written by one of 10 selected writer can be correctly classified. This was done to reduce computing time, but system potentialy is not limited to this number.
  Exhausting code method were chosen for Error-Correcting Output Coding. Since in this case k = 10 I had to use GSAT algorithm in order to choose the most suitable columns. I ended up with 39 columns selected by the algorithm. It means that to achieve our goal 39 binary classifiers needed to be trained. For classification part the jnisvmlight library was chosen. It proved to be reliable and flexible tool. 
  In coclusion the goal was achieved. The system was able to identify authors of the texts it never seen before with precision of 85%.
